sort1: → bubble worst case Big O N^2 while best case Omega N

sorted50000 → 0.40s

reverse50000 → 6.5s

sort2: merge pretty fast in both cases. Has to check regardless of order. Theta N log(N)

sorted50000 → 0.28ss

reversed50000 → 0.35s

sort3: linear Theta N^2 so makes no difference if ordered or not, slow

sorted 50000 → 4 s

reversed50000 → 4s
